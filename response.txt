We very much thank the referee for the time spent on preparing the report, 
the timely response, and very valuable comments. All of them are addressed 
in detail below.
We have considered them carefully, in particular the issue with too broad
Hbeta absorption, and think that the paper has now further gained in 
strength and clarity. The changes are marked in bold-face in the 
revised version.

The submitted manuscript presents observations of the host galaxy of
GRB980425/SN1998bw with the integral-field spectrograph MUSE at the
VLT. GRB980425/SN1998bw is the closest GRB to date and more
importantly, the first GRB for which an accompanying supernova was
observed. The observations result in detailed maps of emission line
strengths and ratios, leading to maps of star formation rate, dust
extinction and oxygen abundance or metallicity using different
diagnostics. The authors use these to maps to infer a young
environment for the GRB/SN, mild extinction towards it, with a
progenitor mass in the range 25-40 solar masses. Interestingly, they
show that the metallicity diagnostic based on [OIII] and/or [NII]
(O3N2) shows a strong correlation with ionization parameter, and that
it is not a reliable indicator of the oxygen abundance at low and high
ionization. Finally, they place their results for this large resolved
nearby GRB host galaxy in the context of observations of higher
redshift GRBs, where the metallicity is typically inferred from a
spectrum which includes most or all of the host emission.

It was a pleasure to read this paper; it is very well written, the
analysis appears to be very sound and the interesting results are
discussed in a clear context. Although I do have some suggestions
and a few things that I hope the authors can clarify for me/the
reader (see below), I'm happy to recommend this manuscript for
publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics.

o Related to the last paragraph of both section 4.5 and 4.6: a point
that I was missing in this discussion is that many GRB hosts are
irregular galaxies where it is difficult to determine a center of
the galaxy, and so often a distance of the GRB from the center of
the host is not very meaningful. Also, the authors could mention
here that GRBs tend to originate from the UV-bright regions within
their hosts, which are the same regions from which the SFR-weighted
metallicity is inferred.

-------------------
We have added a notes about these two important issues in 
section 4.5/4.6.
-------------------



o The paper convincingly argues against the hypothesis suggested by
Hammer et al. (2006) that the progenitor of GRB980425/SN1998bw
originates from the WR region. I think this conclusion is well worth
adding to the abstract.

-------------------
Added to the abstract.
-------------------
 

o Although the stellar absorption model in Fig. 2 appears to describe
the overall spectrum very well, the Hbeta absorption seems to be
overestimated as apparent in the resulting Hbeta profile in the
gas-phase spectrum, which appears unphysically wide. Why is that? If
the Hbeta absorption is indeed overestimated, the dust extinction
will be underestimated, and it is the dust extinction that is found
to be substantially lower in this paper than in previous works. So
it would be good if the authors could take away this worry.

------------------
Given the importance that a good Hbeta correction has on our claims, 
we have decided to investigate this issue with more scrutiny. We fully agree
with the assessment that the Hbeta profile was too wide, likely the result of
an overestimated velocity dispersion with which the model of the stellar
continuum was folded in the fit.

We applied the following new analysis:
- Correction of the initial data cube with a telluric model derived from 
the MUSE spectrum of the star at RA:19:35:02.00, Decl:-52:50:21.1 (this 
allows us to include the telluric bands within the continuum model).
- Use a finer grid in the spectral fitting (on co-added 2x2 spaxels)
- Increase of the number of base function in the continuum fit
- Changed fit parameters regarding the kinematical fit of starlight 

The new fit returns significantly lower velocity dispersion, and an better
and more adequate description of the stellar continuum. We believe that the 
updated Fig. 2 now convincingly demonstrates this. With this improved model, 
we re-ran all the analysis and find no significant changes throughout.

------------------




o In Figures 2 and especially A.1 and A.2, it is difficult to see the
stellar component. The authors could improve these figures somewhat;
for example, by showing a zoom in on the continuum, cutting off the
emission lines close to their base, in an additional figure panel.

------------------
These three figures have been changed with adding two (Figure 2) 
or 1 (Figures A.1, A.2)  additional panel. Also the content of the 
figures was improved (see response the above point).

------------------


o The SNR > 3 mentioned in the caption of Fig. 7 is apparently
inconsistent with the corresponding limit mentioned in the text:
SNR >= 5.

-----------------
This has been corrected.
-----------------



o In the abstract the authors report the T_e-derived oxygen abundance
for the SN and WR regions inferred from the archival long-slit FORS2
spectra and the galaxy-integrated abundance from the O3N2/N2
diagnostic. Why not report all three from the Dopita et al. (2016)
abundances inferred from the MUSE data? If the T_e abundances are
considered to be more reliable, the authors could perhaps scale the
Dopita 2016 measurements to those of the T_e abundances, e.g. by
about 0.15 dex as apparent from Fig. B.1, and report the scaled
Dopita 2016 values.

-------------------
We follow this suggestion and provide D16 values scaled by 0.15~dex
according to the co-spatial T_e abundances as our best estimate for
abundance. This changes only the SN site abundace by 0.1 dex 
(to higher values). Abstract and Conclusions have been updated 
accordingly.
-------------------



o When determining the galaxy-integrated properties, all spaxels
(within 50" diameter) are taken into acccount, or just those that
reach a signal-to-noise ratio (in a line or property) of at least 3
or 5?
-------------------
We take all spaxels into account to estimate what would have been
measured in case the galaxy would be non-resolved. We have also
tried various cuts in signal-to-noise ratio, and the properties
remain largely unchanged (the galaxy-integrated spectrum is 
dominated by the brightest, highest S/N spaxels).

-------------------

o In Sect. 4.2, paragraph 3: the Halpha and [OIII]5007 EWs limits
listed here are a bit higher than those in Table 1; good to make
them consistent.
-------------------
The limits have been corrected.
-------------------






Minor suggestions:



- abstract, last line: "than" --> "to"
- section 1, paragraph 8: "extend" --> "extent"
- caption Fig. 5: diameter rather than radius of 180pc?
- last paragraph of section 4.3: a word is missing after "previous"
- figure 6: extend it over both columns so the size is similar to the
other maps
- first paragraph of section 4.4.2: "immediately" --> "directly"
- last line of section 4.4.4: "galaxies" --> "galaxy"
- first par. of sect. 4.4.5, last line: switch "both" and
"[SIII](6312)"
- first line sect. 4.6: "closest GRB since the discovery of GRB
afterglows"?
- conclusions, par. 2: "emphasize" --> "emphasis"
- same par.: 100pc --> 160pc like elsewhere in the paper
- conclusion (vii): "upper" --> "above" 
-------------------
These have all been fixed.
